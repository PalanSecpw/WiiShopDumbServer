# WiiShopDumbServer
Wii Shop Channel dumb server. Instructions on PS5GAMERS channel.


# Installing things

Before opening the host you need to install some stuff (Evto , AuthSDK and WAMServing). If you want an optimal server also install Dlophin


# Editing authorized.wiimsk

This file specifies which Wii can access the server. The ID would be the ID for the mail and the MAC ..... you already know, don't you?



# Hosting.
